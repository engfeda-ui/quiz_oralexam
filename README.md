A specialized Moodle Quiz Report sub-plugin designed for **in-person Oral and Practical Examinations (OSCE, Oral Defenses, and Technical Workshop assessments)**. It allows examiners and instructors to directly assess and grade students question-by-question live on behalf of the student without requiring student self-submission, while linking each question directly to its competency from `qbank_comp_ext`.

  - **Seamless Mixed Arabic & English Rendering**: Arabic question phrasing, technical English terminology (e.g. `Fixed Water Spray`), punctuation (e.g. `؟`), and model badges render in proper reading order, regardless of whether Moodle's UI language is set to English (`dir="ltr"`) or Arabic (`dir="rtl"`).
  - **Right-Border Accent Alignment**: Perfectly aligned model visual card borders on the right side next to the text start.

  - **Dynamic Card Filtering**: Clicking any model button instantly filters all 40 questions on screen, displaying only the selected candidate's model variant with zero cognitive clutter.

  - **40-Question Multi-Model GIFT Bank**: Bundled a complete 40-question, 3-model balanced GIFT question bank (`oral_exam_40_questions_bank.gift.txt`) covering Operation, Troubleshooting, Testing & Inspection, and Safety competencies.

### v1.3.2 (2026-09-09)
- **Realistic Duration Tracking & Prominent Audio Player Review Card:**
  - **Accurate Duration Tracking**: Added `evaluation_started_at` session tracking to record real elapsed oral evaluation times, completely eliminating the false `now` duration bug (caused by 0-second difference) and preventing multi-day duration anomalies.
  - **Prominent Review Attempt Audio Card**: Upgraded the embedded audio player inside Moodle's native `review.php` comments with a styled, branded emerald card (`🎙️ Student Audio Answer`) ensuring instant visual prominence.

### v1.3.1 (2026-09-09)
- **Ultra-Low Bitrate Speech Tuning & Multi-Format Compression:**
  - **16 kbps Mono Voice Compression**: Configured `MediaRecorder` with `audioBitsPerSecond: 16000` and stream constraints (`channelCount: 1`, `sampleRate: 16000`, `noiseSuppression: true`, `echoCancellation: true`), slashing audio file sizes down to ~90–120 KB per minute (up to ~80% footprint reduction).
  - **Multi-Container Support (`WebM` / `MP4` / `OGG`)**: Enhanced `evaluator.php` to seamlessly store, detect, and stream audio across modern desktop and mobile browsers (including Safari iOS) without format incompatibilities.

### v1.3.0 (2026-09-09)
- **Multi-Attempt Switcher Tabs & In-Browser Voice Recording:**
  - **Multi-Attempt Navigation Tabs**: When viewing an evaluated candidate, examiners can seamlessly switch between past finished attempts (Attempt #1, Attempt #2...) to review past marks, notes, and audio answers.
  - **Explicit Retake Initiation**: Dedicated `[ ➕ Record New Attempt (Retake) ]` action button opens a fresh, blank evaluation form without overwriting previous attempts.
  - **Live HTML5 Voice Recording**: Integrated MediaRecorder per question allowing examiners to record student oral answers live in lightweight Opus WebM/MP4 format with live timers and instant playback preview.
  - **Enterprise Audio Storage & Dual-View Playback**: Audio recordings are saved securely in Moodle File Storage API (`audio_recordings`) via `lib.php:quiz_oralexam_pluginfile()` and play back both in the Oral Evaluation station and within Moodle's native Review Attempt (`review.php`) page.

### v1.2.1 (2026-09-09)
- **Disable Oral Evaluation Station for Regular Quizzes:**
  - When opening the Oral Evaluation report tab on a regular (non-oral) quiz, the grading station, candidate roster, and score inputs are completely hidden.
  - Displays an informative, friendly advisory card explaining that direct grading is disabled because the quiz is not designated as an oral exam.
  - Provides a direct action button for teachers to enable Oral Exam mode in Quiz Settings if they intended it to be an oral assessment.
  - Strictly blocks any incoming POST submissions if the quiz is not an oral exam.

### v1.2.0 (2026-09-09)
- **Critical Bug Fix — Prevent Accidental Oral Exam Conversion:**
  - Removed the dangerous auto-enable block in `report.php` that was silently converting any regular quiz to an oral exam the moment a teacher opened the Oral Evaluation tab.
  - Oral exam mode (`oralexamenabled`) must now be explicitly set by a teacher through the quiz Settings form (`Edit settings`); it is never toggled automatically on page load.
  - This prevents the permanent lock-out of students from regular quizzes that had already been completed.

### v1.1.9 (2026-09-08)
- **Enforced Sub-Plugin Dependency (`quizaccess_oralexam`):** Declared `$plugin->dependencies['quizaccess_oralexam'] = 2026090800` in `version.php`. Moodle installer will now automatically require both `quiz_oralexam` and `quizaccess_oralexam` to be installed together, preventing standalone installations and ensuring strict student access control and automatic evaluation locking.

### v1.1.8 (2026-09-08)
- **Enhanced Candidate Card Typography & Compact Status Badges:** Replaced the wide text-heavy `Pending Evaluation` label with a sleek, circular pending clock icon badge (🕒) with native tooltip hover. Expanded the left sidebar width to `365px` to provide ample breathing room for full student names and academic ID pills without text truncations, while retaining the score badge (`30 pts`) for evaluated candidates.

### v1.1.7 (2026-09-08)
- **Fixed Candidate List Collapsing / Shrinking in All Participants View:** Fixed CSS flexbox layout issue where `.oralexam-candidate-item` lacked `flex-shrink: 0` and `min-height: 52px`, causing all 40 student cards in the "All participants" sidebar to squish into 18px empty bars when squeezed inside the flex container. Added explicit scroll boundaries (`max-height: 720px`, `min-height: 0`, `flex: 1 1 auto`) to ensure smooth scrolling and complete visibility of student names, IDs, and evaluation status badges.

### v1.1.6 (2026-09-08)
- **Fixed PHP Type Hint Mismatch (`cm_info` vs `stdClass`):** Removed rigid `\stdClass` type hint on `$cm`, `$quiz`, and `$course` in `evaluator::submit_evaluation()`. In Moodle 4.x/5.x, `$cm` is an instance of `\cm_info`, which caused a PHP `TypeError` during evaluation submission.
- **Upgraded Exception Handling:** Changed `catch (\Exception $e)` to `catch (\Throwable $e)` in `report.php` to safely capture any potential runtime errors or type errors and display user-friendly notifications.

### v1.1.5 (2026-09-08)
- **Fixed Form POST Routing & Redirect Loop:** Added mandatory hidden routing fields (`id`, `mode=oralexam`, `sesskey`, `action=submitevaluation`, and `studentid`) and used unescaped `$PAGE->url->out(false)` to prevent query parameters from being stripped by browser form submissions.

### v1.1.4 (2026-09-08)
- **Comprehensive Security & Architecture Audit:**
  - Converted batch queries in `evaluator::get_candidates()` to parameterized prepared statements using `$DB->get_in_or_equal()`.
  - Added strict capabilities `quiz/oralexam:view` and `quiz/oralexam:evaluate`.
  - Replaced native `alert()` and `confirm()` with non-blocking modern UI dialogues.

### v1.1.3 (2026-09-08)
- **Multi-Attempt Auto-Increment & Zero-Fill Unrated Questions:**
  - Submitting an evaluation for an already-graded student now automatically increments the attempt number.
  - Automatically assigns `0.0` to unrated questions upon confirmation.

### v1.0.0 (2026-09-07)
- **Initial Release:** Core oral evaluation interface, question card layout, quick scores, and direct Moodle Gradebook synchronization.
